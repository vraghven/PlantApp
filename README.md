## Overview
### Description
A reminder app where you can log your plants and be reminded of when they need to be watered. You can also puruse plant facts and find places that these plants are sold.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app would primarily be a mobile app as its main purposes are to remind and most people have their phones costantly as opposed to their laptop. 
- **Story:** Analyzes plant needs and sets reminders, and people can explore different plants sold near them.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app. Especially in quarantine, many people have bought plants and they have become increasingly popular on social media as well.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wants, depending on how much time they would like to spend taking care of their plants. 
- **Scope:** First, we would start with features surrounding taking care of the user's plants, but it would also be interesting to expand scope and suggest that the user can learn about and purchase other plants on our explore page.
